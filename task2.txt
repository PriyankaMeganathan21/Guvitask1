              Object and its internal representation in javascript
 
Object is an unordered collection of relatedd data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of
"key: value" pairs.
These key can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in context 
of an object.
Object are different than primitive datatypes. Primitive data types contain one value but Objects
can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.

Example:  let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age:"50"};

Object Properties:

The named values in javascript objects are called properties.
Here John, Doe, 50 are all properties.

Object Methods:

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

An object method is a object property containing a function definition.
